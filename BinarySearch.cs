* BinarySearch.cs
* -------------
* 
* A binary search implementation for the generic List class. It expects the list
* to be SORTED already.
* 
*  - If the exact value is found it returns the index of that value.
*  - If the exact value is not found the method returns a negative value. That
*    value represents the negative index of the closest element minus 1. So a
*    value of "-1" means the closest element is "0". If it's "-2" the closest
*    element is "1"
*    
* This method can work with any ordered List, no matter if it's sorted in
* ascending or descending order.
